# HabEx: Expense & Habit Tracker üéØ
A web application which uses HTML,CSS,JS and Python Data Analytics tools to track and analyze a user's habits and expenses, ultimately leading to informed decisions and a balanced life.

HabEx is a full-stack web application designed to help users track their personal expenses and daily habits.The goal is a simple yet functional web app with a clean UI, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and insightful analytics powered by Python.

This project was built as a personal portfolio piece to demonstrate skills in backend development with Flask, database management with SQLite, and data visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib.


## ‚ú® Features

* **Full CRUD for Expenses & Habits:** Users can add, view, edit, and delete both expense records and habit logs through dedicated pages.
* **Expense Analysis:** The application can generate and display a pie chart that shows the breakdown of expenses by category, providing a clear visual of spending patterns.
* **Habit Consistency Analysis:** Users can generate a bar chart that tracks the consistency of completed habits over time, helping to visualize their progress.
* **Central Dashboard:** A home page offers an overview and quick links to all major features of the application.
* **Persistent Storage:** All data is stored in a lightweight SQLite database, ensuring information is saved between sessions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Flask
* **Database:** SQLite with the Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM.
* **Data Analytics:** Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data processing and visualization.
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 for templating.


## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses two tables to store data:

1.  **`expenses` table:**
    * `id` (Integer, Primary Key)
    * `date` (Date)
    * `category` (String)
    * `amount` (Float)
    * `description` (String, nullable)
2.  **`habits` table:**
    * `id` (Integer, Primary Key)
    * `date` (Date)
    * `habit_name` (String)
    * `status` (Boolean)
